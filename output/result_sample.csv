law,Can contract text itself be subject to copyright?,copyright,"It largely depends on the originality of your contract. J Management Corp. v. Anderson, 707 F.Supp.2d 858, 862 (2009) points to multiple references against preclusion of ""a copyrightable interest in a contract"". But you would need to prove that your competitor copied ""original elements"" of your contract including ""a minimum degree of creativity and originality required to support a valid copyright"". Your post provides no information that would help identifying or ruling out this issue in your matter.Without realizing, you might have paid dearly for boilerplate language that your lawyer copied from somewhere else. Indeed, there is so much regurgitation and copy/pasting in the legal ""profession"". That regurgitation is not bad in and of itself, though, since what matters is the expeditious administration of justice and the protection of your rights, rather than obtaining creative expressions authored by some lawyer. You might end up wasting valuable energy and money if you went after the competitor for something like this without first assessing the extent of originality in your contract. Focus instead on the much more detrimental fact that your competitor ""plays dirty in general"". ",0.9616
law,"Does the ""70 years after death"" rule 
always apply unconditionally?",criminal-law,"The issue is discussed in quite a few cases, including an in depth discussion in Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186 (2003). The Official Syllabus of that decision summarizes its analysis:The Copyright and Patent Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8,provides as to copyrights: Congress shall have Power ... [t]o promotethe Progress of Science ... by securing [to Authors] for limited Times... the exclusive Right to their ... Writings In the 1998 CopyrightTerm Extension Act (CTEA), Congress enlarged the duration ofcopyrights by 20 years: Under the 1976 Copyright Act, copyright protection generally lasted from a work's creation until 50years after the author's death; under the CTEA, most copyrights nowrun from creation until 70 years after the author's death. As in the case of prior copyright extensions, principally in1831, 1909, and 1976, Congress provided for application of theenlarged terms to existing and future copyrights alike.Petitioners, whose products or services build on copyrighted worksthat have gone into the public domain, brought this suit seeking adetermination that the CTEA fails constitutional review under both theCopyright Clause's  limited Times prescription and the FirstAmendment's free speech guarantee.",0.6986
law,"Legal to create a backup of website

biology,"Do blood glucose ""spikes"" contribute to insulin resistance, or is prolonged elevation required?",human-biology,"The biggest problem is persistent insulin signaling from prolonged excessive high blood glucose over time. The reason being that it is this kind of signaling that results in insulin insensitivity due to down-regulation of the insulin receptors. Any bolus of carbohydrates > ~ 25grams in a sitting is going to bump up blood sugar at a fast enough rate to warrant the release of insulin to help lower blood sugar levels.  This can be mitigated by an excessive amount of fat along with the carbohydrates, thus slowing down the spike.  The thought process is that people that have less glycogen or higher energy needs, don't have insulin insensitivity; thus the same amount of insulin would do a better job of shuttling glucose into cells.  We know that consistent exercise increases insulin sensitivity, as does lack of persistent insulin signaling.  ",0.7385
biology,Pasteurization and Bioavailability of Antioxidants in Beet Juice,biochemistry,"When they subjected ""ready to drink"" beetroot juice to thermal pasteurization, they found the betacyanin and betaxanthin (our major antioxidants, and pigment molecules) content to be 39.9 and 42.28% degraded, respectively. Standardization of process condition and quality degradation of beetroot juice due to thermal pasteurization was studied. The standardized T2 batch with total heating time of 720 s thermal in-pack pasteurization leads to the minimal degradation of color, betalain content, antioxidant activity and complete inactivation of micro flora of beetroot juice. The color, betalain content antioxidant activity and sensory of the beetroot juice was significantly reduced during 180 days ambient (27-30°C) storage, but still the quality of the juice was adequate upto 180 days.
